# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions

My solutions for Advent of Code 2024 puzzles using Python ('Python/') and C++ ('cpp/').

# Structure

The full description of the daily problems can be found at https://adventofcode.com/2024.
As the applications are quite simple, I have decided to include all the Python files as well as all the C++ files in their respective directories. Thank to this arrangements, the executables and the input data will be located in the same directory, removing the need for adding extra directories when accessing the text files.

Contents of Python directory: A Python Script, a Jupyter Notebook (for a more interactive session) and a text file containing the input data for every single day.
Contents of C++ folder: A .cpp script and a text file containing the input data for every single day.

# How to Run

Python

1. Run the script using Python 3.x:

python day01.py

It can also be run directly from the executable file (.py) - as it opens a console.

2. Insert the name of the file (it is indicated when asked for an input).

3. Select the part to solve (as indicated in the website, every problem consists of two parts).

C++

1. Use the command cd in the cmd window to set the current directory to where the cpp files are located.

2. Once the cd has been set, run the next line to create an executable (example for day01 and the g++ compiler):

g++ -std=c++17 -o day01 day01.cpp

3. To execute the program, run the next line in the cmd window (example for day01):

day01

4. Insert the name of the file (it is indicated when asked for an input).

5. Select the part to solve (as indicated in the website, every problem consists of two parts).
